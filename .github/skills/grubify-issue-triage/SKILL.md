# Grubify Issue Triage — Demo Skill

Run **Act 3: Workflow Automation** for the GrubifyIncidentLab demo. This skill seeds sample
customer issues in a GitHub repo and lets the `issue-triager` subagent classify, label, and
comment on each one.

## Working directory

Always run commands from the GrubifyIncidentLab demo directory:

```bash
cd /workspaces/AzSreAgentLab/demos/GrubifyIncidentLab
```

## Step 1: Verify prerequisites

### 1a) GitHub PAT and user are configured

```bash
azd env get-value GITHUB_PAT 2>/dev/null | head -c 10 && echo "... (PAT set)"
azd env get-value GITHUB_USER 2>/dev/null
```

Both must return values. The PAT needs `repo` scope.

### 1b) Verify the issue-triager subagent exists on the SRE Agent

```bash
AGENT_ENDPOINT=$(azd env get-value SRE_AGENT_ENDPOINT 2>/dev/null)
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://azuresre.dev --query accessToken -o tsv)
curl -s "${AGENT_ENDPOINT}/api/v2/extendedAgent/agents/issue-triager" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'Name: {d[\"name\"]}')"
```

Should print `Name: issue-triager`.

### 1c) Verify the scheduled task is active

```bash
curl -s "${AGENT_ENDPOINT}/api/v1/scheduledtasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | python3 -c "
import sys,json
for t in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print(f'{t[\"name\"]} ({t[\"cronExpression\"]}) -> {t.get(\"agent\",\"(none)\")} [{t.get(\"status\",\"?\")}]')
"
```

Look for `triage-grubify-issues` (cron `0 */12 * * *` → `issue-triager`).

## Step 2: Create sample customer issues

The user must provide the target GitHub repo in `owner/repo` format. If not provided, ask for it.

```bash
export GITHUB_PAT=$(azd env get-value GITHUB_PAT 2>/dev/null)
./scripts/create-sample-issues.sh <owner/repo>
```

This creates 5 realistic customer-reported issues prefixed with `[Customer Issue]`:

| # | Title | Expected classification |
|---|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | App crashes when adding items to cart | api-bug / memory-leak |
| 2 | Menu page loading slowly | performance |
| 3 | Can't place an order — 500 error | api-bug |
| 4 | Feature request — add restaurant search | feature-request |
| 5 | How do I clear my cart? | question |

## Step 3: Trigger or wait for triage

The `issue-triager` runs on a 12-hour cron schedule. Options to trigger it sooner:

- **SRE Agent portal**: Open https://sre.azure.com → find the `triage-grubify-issues` scheduled task → Run Now
- **Wait**: The cron will fire on the next 12-hour boundary

## Step 4: Verify triage results

After the triager runs, check GitHub issues in the target repo. Each `[Customer Issue]` should have:

1. **Classification labels** applied (e.g., `api-bug`, `memory-leak`, `feature-request`, `question`)
2. **A triage comment** starting with `🤖 **Grubify SRE Agent Bot**` containing:
   - Classification and sub-category
   - Brief analysis
   - Next steps or questions for the reporter
   - Status indicator

## Success criteria

- [ ] 5 sample issues created in the GitHub repo
- [ ] Scheduled task `triage-grubify-issues` is active
- [ ] After triage: issues have labels applied and triage comments posted
- [ ] Classifications are reasonable (cart crash → api-bug/memory-leak, search request → feature-request, etc.)

## Constraints

- Requires `GITHUB_PAT` with `repo` scope
- The GitHub MCP connector must be active on the SRE Agent
- Issue titles must contain `[Customer Issue]` to be picked up by the triager
- Do not manually label or comment on the issues — let the agent do it
